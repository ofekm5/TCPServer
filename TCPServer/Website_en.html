Take that as you will;
The death of mediocrity
jumping fist,
and foreign determination in our step
From our seat on the shoulders of giants
Miracle of Rebellion:
craftsmanship

and fight on stage
and on a background
And on the lost honor of another written word
And we will win
No solution, but with an answer
and simple memory

But this memory has a foreign smell
and not letting go
Like simple words for a thinking person
Who returns an angry mob from sin and thunder,
to the wild tracks,
on the soil of the mouth
